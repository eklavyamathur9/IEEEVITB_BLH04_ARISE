Project Discription : This innovative platform addresses communication barriers in business meetings through a comprehensive suite of   tools. The system incorporates sentiment analysis to gauge participant engagement and automatically generates meeting summaries with action item tracking. Designed to function seamlessly across video calls, in-person meetings, and hybrid setups, this unified solution aims to boost understanding, participation, and overall productivity by breaking down language, cultural, and accessibility barriers that often hinder effective business communication.

Technologies Used : HTML, CSS, JS

Future Enhancements : Enhancing an application designed to remove communication barriers can significantly improve user experience and inclusivity. One key enhancement would be implementing real-time translation for both text and voice, allowing seamless communication between speakers of different languages. Additionally, integrating voice-to-text and text-to-voice capabilities can assist users who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have speech difficulties by converting spoken language to text and vice versa. Augmented Reality (AR) translation is another innovative feature, enabling users to translate signs, menus, and other real-world text through their deviceâ€™s camera. These features, combined with improvements in user interface design to ensure accessibility for individuals with disabilities, can make the application more comprehensive and effective in bridging communication gaps.
